# Data Card 

## Motivation 

> **For what purpose was the dataset created?** 

The dataset is created for the experiment section of our paper 'Action Inference by Maximising Evidence: Zero-Shot Imitation from Observation with World Models' at NeurIPS 2023 to pretrained world models and do imitation learning. We release the datasets for the community as a common test bench for similar problems. 

> **Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?** 

The dataset is collected by Zoefia during his Ph.D. at Machine Learning Research Lab at Volkswagen AG. 

## Uses 

> **Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?** 

Yes, the datasets has been used in our AIME paper for pretraining world models and imitation learning from observation. 

> **Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset?** 

No. 

> **What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?** 

The datasets can also be used for offline reinforcement learning. 

> **Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses?** 

No. Everything from the simulator is recorded in the dataset. 

> **Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?** 

Not at the moment.
